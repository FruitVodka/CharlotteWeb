Description:

	Charlotte's Web is a website that presents mini-games with an interwoven storyline. The premise of this game is that the user
	is trapped in the spider's 'Web'. The user will be presented with a series of mini-games, solving each holds the key to the 
	next. The objective is to navigate through the pages successfully and escape the Web before time runs out.

	Some key points are:
		Users must register and sign in to play this game (MySQL and sessions).
		Users can change the theme and audio settings of the homepage based on their preference (Local Storage).
		The three mini-games included are Hangman, Memory Card Game and Scavenger Hunt (HTML5 canvas, CSS3 animations).
		The mini-games can be played in different orders based on an initial selection, and each one must be completed before
		playing the next (Javascript Cookies).
		
	Javascript is used extensively to accomplish basic client-side validation, for the gameplay and DOM manipulation. PHP is used
	to maintain sessions and to access the database of users and provide server-side validation. CSS is used for the presentation 
	of the pages.
